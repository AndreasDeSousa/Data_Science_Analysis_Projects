This Project is the first part of 2, which will focus on:
* Download and prepare the dataset in CSV ([Link to Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths))
* create a new database in pandas and import the dataset
* Explore and analyze the dataset

The second part of the project, that you can find [here](https://github.com/AndreasDeSousa/Data_Science_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/Data%20Visualization/Tableau/Covid19) will focus on export, 
manipulate and prepare the dataset and visualize it.
